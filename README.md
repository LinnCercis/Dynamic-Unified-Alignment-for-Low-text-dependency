# Dynamic-Unified-Alignment-for-Low-text-dependency
DUAL (Dynamic Unified Alignment for Low-text dependency) is a multimodal emotion recognition model that aligns audio and visual features nonlinearly, introduces text only at decoding for refinement, and models temporal dynamics and cross-modal complementarity through differential and residual mechanisms.
